WebIDE is a native Android Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for web front-end development. Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, this project implements a complete workflow ranging from code editing to building APKs directly on your mobile device.

This is an experimental engineering project; its core architecture and code logic were collaboratively completed by multiple AI models (Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek).
